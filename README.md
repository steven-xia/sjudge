`sjudge` is a client-side programming judge made for use as a teaching tool.
It is programmed in pure Python and designed to be as simple and robust as possible.

The differences between `sjudge` and the many available online judges is that `sjudge` is designed for small classroom 
use and the simplicity for a teacher to make their modifications if they so desire.

### Supported Platforms

Operating systems:

  * Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus)
  * Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver)
  * Windows 10

Python versions:

  * Python 3.7.x
  * Python 3.8.x

### When (and why) I should use `sjudge`?

`sjudge` is a "programming judge", which means that it is a tool used to test programs to see if they work as expected.
However, contrary to most other judges, `sjudge` is locally run which results in a simpler design.
Along with it also comes with a set of advantages and disadvantages:

Advantages:

  * Simple design for easy configurability.
  * No fear of students trying to undermine your machine.

Disadvantages:

  * Programs' performance is affected by machine usage.
  * Smart students can technically access the test cases.
