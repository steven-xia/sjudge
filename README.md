`sjudge` is a client-side programming judge made for use as a teaching tool.
It is programmed in pure Python and designed to be as simple and robust as possible.

The differences between `sjudge` and the many available online judges is that `sjudge` is designed for small classroom 
use and the simplicity for a teacher to make their modifications if they so desire.
