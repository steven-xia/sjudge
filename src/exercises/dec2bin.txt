Description:
    Given a sequence of binary numbers, convert them into decimal
    numbers.

Input Specification:
    The input consists of many test cases. The first line consists of
    a single integer, T (0 <= T <= 5000), the number of test cases.

    Each test case consists of a single string, S (1 <= |S| <= 64),
    of '1's and '0's.

Output Specification:
    The output for each test case consists of a single number, the
    decimal representation of `S` if `S` were to be interpreted as a
    binary number.
