Description:
    Given a system of equations with `N` unknowns, solve it.

Input Specification:
    The first line consists of a single number `N` (1 <= N <= 12).

    The next `N` lines consists of `N` numbers each listed as such:

        C_0_a C_0_b C_0_c C_0_d ...
        C_1_a C_1_b C_1_c C_1_d ...
        ...

    where `C_n_k` is the coefficient of the `k`th unknown in the `n`th
    equation. (-128 <= `C_n_k` < 128)

    The last line consists of `N` numbers, the answers (right side) to the
    linear equations in the order that their coefficients were given.

Output Specification:
    The output consists of `N` lines, with the value of the `i`th unknown on
    line `i` (in the order that their coefficients were given).
