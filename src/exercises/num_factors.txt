Description:
    Given a non-negative integer `N`, find the number of non-negative integers that
    are factors of `N`. If there are an unlimited number of factors, output `inf`.

Input Specification:
    The input consists of one line containing the number `N` (0 <= `N` < 10^12).

Output Specification:
    The output consists of one line containing the number of non-negative integers
    that are factors of `N`, or `inf` if there is an unlimited number.
