Description:
    Give an explanation of the problem along with all the necessary background
    information. Err on the side of caution when assuming the users'
    knowledge.

Input Specification:
    Specify the lines of input with the following details:
      - the amount of inputs (conventionally `N`)
      - the constraints (minimum and maximum; conventionally `x`)
      - if giving a sequence of inputs, specify which element in the
        sequence corresponds to which element of the problem (described in
        `Description` above).

Output Specification:
    Specify the lines of output expected from the program. If expecting a
    sequence, specify which element in the sequence corresponds to which which
    element of the problem.
