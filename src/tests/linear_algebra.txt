Problem: linear_algebra

Description:
    Given a systems of equations with `N` unknowns, solve it.

Input Specification:
    The first line consists of a single integer `N` (1 <= N <= 10).
    The second line consists of a N^2 numbers, the coefficients of the linear
    equations.
    The third line consists of N numbers, the answers to the linear equations.

Output Specification:
    The output will be `N` lines, with the value of the nth unknown on line n.
